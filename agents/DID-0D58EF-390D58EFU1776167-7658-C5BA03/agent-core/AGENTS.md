## Shopify store building — 5-stage workflow

Execute all stages yourself with real tools and the Shopify API. Explain each step in plain language as you go so the user learns alongside you.

### Stage 1 — Theme-Based Product Sourcing

This stage runs in **two separate phases** to prevent data mixing between Amazon and Alibaba sources.

#### Phase A: Amazon Market Research (Jungle Scout)
- Confirm the store niche/theme with the user first (e.g., "pet accessories", "home office gadgets")
- Call `js_product_database_query` with **strict parameter constraints**:
  - `page_size`: **10–15** (NEVER default 50 — causes context overflow and ASIN confusion)
  - `categories`: specify the relevant Amazon category — **must be a JSON array**, e.g. `["Pet Supplies"]`
  - `min_revenue`: **3000–5000** (filters low-demand products)
  - `min_price` / `max_price`: adapt to niche (general default $15–$80; electronics $30–$200; fashion accessories $10–$50)
  - `exclude_unavailable_products`: **true**
  - `include_keywords`: 2–3 specific niche keywords — **must be a JSON array**, e.g. `["yoga mat", "eco friendly"]` (string value will cause a validation error)
- **Deduplicate by `parent_asin`** — group variants, keep one representative per unique product; discard noise fields (`variants`, `fee_breakdown`, dimensions)
- Present an **Amazon-only** table: thumbnail (from `image_url`), product name, parent ASIN, price, revenue/sales metrics, category, Amazon link — no Alibaba data
- Write shortlist to `project/jungle-scout-shortlist.md`
- **⛔ STOP and present to user.** Ask which products to find suppliers for. **Do NOT call `product_supplier_search` in the same turn.**

#### Phase B: Supplier Matching (Alibaba) — only after user confirms Phase A
- **HARD GATE**: only runs after user explicitly confirms products from Phase A
- For each confirmed product, call `product_supplier_search` **one at a time**; aim for **3–5 suppliers per product**
- Label each section: "**Supplier Match for: [Product Name] (ASIN: Bxxx)**"
- Table per product — **must include**: thumbnail (`<img src="alibaba-cdn-url" width="80">`), supplier name, unit cost, MOQ, shipping est., single clickable product link (Alibaba product URL — do NOT duplicate as a "Supplier Store" link)
- Flag approximate matches with ⚠️ and note "Verify product similarity before ordering"
- Build combined shortlist with margin math (Amazon link + Alibaba supplier link per row)
- Get user approval on final product list before moving to Stage 2

### Stage 2 — Bulk Product Listing
- Collect from supplier: title, full description, all images (main + variant/detail shots), price, variants, weight/dimensions
- Enhance images if needed (background removal / brightness) — physical product must remain identical to the supplier's actual item; never swap or add product elements that don't exist
- Write SEO title (≤ 80 chars) + description (200–400 words) in the store's target language; include key features, use cases, and a call to action
- Create product via Shopify API: title, description, images, price, compare-at price, variants, weight; set **status = active** so it publishes immediately
- Show the live product URL to the user after each upload

### Stage 3 — Store Decoration

#### Aesthetic, tone & diversity
- Define the store's visual identity in one sentence before starting (e.g., "minimalist Nordic calm", "vibrant street energy") — all visuals must align with it
- Choose a 3-color palette + 2-font pair; apply via theme settings API; keep consistent lighting and composition across all assets
- Catalog spans ≥ 3 sub-categories; each collection page gets a 2-sentence editorial intro explaining why these products belong together
- Homepage features three price tiers: impulse buy (≤ $20), hero product ($30–$60), premium ($80+)

#### Promotional atmosphere
- Add a site-wide announcement bar: e.g., "🎉 Grand Opening — Free shipping over $35" or "⏰ 15% off with code WELCOME15"
- Include a "Deals" section on the homepage with 2–3 items showing crossed-out compare-at prices + urgency labels ("Only X left in stock")
- **[MANDATORY] Homepage hero banner**: generate a high-quality banner image (≥ 1920×1080 px) with promotional headline overlay; **you must upload it to the store via Shopify theme assets API AND set it as the active homepage banner** — do not skip or defer this step. Confirm to the user with the banner preview URL after it is live.

#### Product detail pages — high-quality visuals (mandatory)
Every product in the store **must** have a fully built-out detail page before Stage 3 is considered complete:
- Generate or source **≥ 5 product images** per listing: (1) clean white/neutral background hero shot, (2) lifestyle/in-use scene, (3) close-up of key feature or material texture, (4) scale/size reference shot, (5) packaging or unboxing shot if available
- **Image fidelity rule (strictly enforced)**: every generated or enhanced image must depict the same physical product as the supplier's original — identical shape, color, material, and markings. No adding, removing, or substituting product elements. If an image cannot be generated faithfully, use the original supplier image instead and note `[original supplier image]`
- Write a structured description with: headline → 3–5 bullet-point benefits → materials/specs table → care/usage instructions → shipping & return note
- Set compare-at price and sale price to show a clear discount where applicable
- Upload all images to the product via Shopify API; set the first image as the featured (main) image

#### Core steps
- Create collections, assign all products, upload collection cover images
- Final QA: before browsing the live storefront, check if it is password-protected (new Shopify stores are locked by default). If so, guide the user to: **Shopify Admin → Online Store → Preferences → Storefront password** — copy the password shown there. Then open the store URL, click **"Enter using password"** on the landing page, and enter the password to access the store. Screenshot homepage + a sample product page via browser tool; share with user for sign-off

### Stage 4 — Social Media Marketing

**Use the `social-media-publisher` skill** to publish to X (Twitter) and Instagram when it is available — it handles formatting, hashtags, and media attachments; you must still follow authorization and copy rules below.

**Both Twitter (X) and Instagram are required.** **Twitter:** exactly **one** tweet (no threads). **Instagram:** follow the formats below (carousel, single-image launch, Stories, hashtag bank). Each post includes at least one product image (direct URL only).

#### Authorization (required before posting)
Before drafting or sending any post, **explicitly ask the user to authorize access** for each platform:
- **Twitter (X)**: "To post on your behalf, I need access to your Twitter account. Please authorize via [the Twitter OAuth link] or paste your API credentials (API Key + Access Token)."
- **Instagram**: "To post on your Instagram account, I need your Instagram Business Account ID and access token (via Meta Developer / connected Facebook Page). Please provide these or authorize via the login flow."
Do not attempt to post on either platform until the user has confirmed authorization for that platform.

#### Twitter (X)
- **Single tweet only** (≤ 280 chars): niche hook + product spotlight + image + price/link as needed. **Before the attribution:** insert a newline character (`\n`) immediately before `This post wrote itself. @Accio_official #MyAccioWorks` when posting. The tweet **must end with** that exact line as the last line (nothing after it).
- Get user approval on copy + image URL, then post (via `social-media-publisher` or API)

#### Instagram
- **Carousel** per hero product (3–5 slides): lifestyle hook → feature details → price + "Shop now" CTA; caption: Hook → benefits → "Link in bio" → hashtags → **insert a newline character (`\n`) immediately before** the attribution when posting. The caption **must end with** this exact final line (nothing after it): `This post wrote itself. Shout out to @Accio_b2b #MyAccioWorks`
- **Single-image launch post**: brand banner + niche intro; 20–30 hashtags in first comment
- **Stories** (5 frames): "We're live!" → 3 product frames (price + link sticker) → discount code countdown
- Hashtag bank: 20–30 tags per niche (5 high-volume >1M, 10 mid-range, 5 niche-specific, 1 branded)
- Output as card — image description/URL | caption draft | hashtag list; confirm all image URLs are direct links (no HTML page URLs); get user approval, then post (via `social-media-publisher` or API)

#### After successful posts
- **Return links to the user:** After each post succeeds, send the user **clickable permalinks** to the live content (X/Twitter tweet URL; Instagram feed post, reel, or carousel URL as applicable; Stories link if the API provides one). Use URLs returned by the API or `social-media-publisher`; if only an ID is returned, build the public post URL so the user can open it in a browser.

#### Content calendar
2-week table: Date | Platform | Post type | Visual | Caption preview (100 chars) | Hashtags | CTA

### Stage 5 — Daily Monitoring & Optimization

Set up recurring cron tasks using the cron tool. Tasks run automatically and write results to the project directory.

- **Competitor monitor** (daily 09:00): check top 3–5 competitor stores via browser — new products, price changes, promotions, social activity; append findings to `project/competitor-log.md` with date header
- **Traffic & sales digest** (daily 10:00): query Shopify Analytics API for previous day — sessions, conversion rate, AOV, top products by revenue, cart abandonment; append to `project/metrics-log.md`; flag any metric down >10% vs. 7-day average
- **Product optimization** (weekly, Monday): review bottom-5 products by conversion; update titles/descriptions/images where needed; run a Jungle Scout query to surface new winning candidates and recommend additions or removals
- **Strategy digest** (weekly, Monday): synthesize competitor log + metrics into a 1-page summary — top opportunity, top risk, one action item; write to `project/strategy-digest-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and notify the user

### Gating rules
- **Phase A before Phase B** — never call `product_supplier_search` in the same turn as `js_product_database_query`
- **Stage 2 and 3 require a Shopify store + Access Token** — before asking for the token, first confirm the user has a Shopify store; if not, walk them through registration at [shopify.com/free-trial](https://www.shopify.com/free-trial) (open a free trial, pick a plan, set store name and region); only after the store exists, **first read the shopify-builder skill's SKILL.md** via the Read tool, then follow its "Getting API Credentials" section to guide the user through creating a Custom App via the [Shopify Dev Dashboard](https://dev.shopify.com/dashboard) and providing store domain + Client ID + Client Secret
- **Never publish a product without a real supplier source** — every listing must trace back to a real Alibaba/1688 listing
- **Never use an image that misrepresents the physical product** — enhanced images must show the same product as the supplier's original
